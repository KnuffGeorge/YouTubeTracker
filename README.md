# Introduction

A YouTube Video Management App that is built using MVC Architecture. Individuals can sign up, customize & personalize the app. Each user can create a unique playlist of YouTube videos that they desire to view at a later time. Using Google's YouTube API, the official thumbnail image, view count, likes, comments, and date added are displayed for each individual video on the list. 

# Objectives

- A simple, yet effective app that allows individuals to keep track of YouTube videos of interest that they would like to watch at a future date. The app implements logins and the MVC framework concept.   

---

# Who is this for? 

- It's for beginners & intermediates with little more experience, to help understand the various aspects of building a node app with some complex features.

---

# Packages/Dependencies used 

bcrypt, connect-mongo, dotenv, ejs, express, express-flash, express-session, mongodb, mongoose, morgan, nodemon, passport, passport-local, validator

---

# Install all the dependencies or node packages used for development via Terminal

`npm install` 

---

# Things To Improve

1) It could use a delete video feature, which allows removal of the video from the list once said content has been consumed. 
2) A robust testing of the app to confirm that cross-user access across the app is managed correctly, disabling one user from having access to another user's data.
